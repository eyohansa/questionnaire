A Google Form-like app made in native PHP7.

This is a learning project. It might be faster and more reliable to recreate this using a PHP Framework like Laravel/CodeIgniter.

The project does not use object-oriented programming style. I might refactor it at later date.

[Bootstrap 4](https://www.getbootstrap.com) is used for UI.

For a better Form-like experience, authentication and authorization still need to be added. Look into an OAuth2.0 option from Google/Facebook/Twitter/Microsoft.

Another improvement to be made is replacing database access using mysqli to PDO. It should allow the app to change its database without changing much of the code.
